# Photo-Carousel
This is a pretty bare-bones application. For the purposes of the presentation, the db is currently de-coupled from the client, it is a fairly simple fix to move it back. In client/src/index.jsx, change the input to the param to your db output.

There is only 1 large subcomponent, due to time pressure, however each one is sectioned out accordingly. Another sacrifice I made due to time was using a style sheet instead of styled components.

The db is very simple, just a houseName and an album of images. Enjoy!
